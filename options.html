  <h1>Tab Historian</h1>

  <p>This Chrome extension will let you restore tabs and their history.

  <p>The extension keeps track of your browsing, and is then able to restore
    tabs (complete with history!) on command. The tabs can be kept around for
    as long as you wish, and are not arbitrarily forgotten (like the ‘Recent
    tabs’ are).

  <p>Since the Google Chrome API does not give access to each tab’s past
    history, this extension remember history that has occurred since it was
    installed. Browsing history that takes place while the extension is off is
    not registered.
