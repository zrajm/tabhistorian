** TODO How to restore tab with history?
   Use pushstate?

   Or could this work (inside popup, executeScript() is needed).
   $('#color').click(() => {
       chrome.tabs.executeScript({
           code: 'document.location = myNewUrl;'
       });
   });
* TODO Populate on startup                                           :NEEDED:
  When started add all the current pages to the menu -- can't add history, but
  can add the current page. So do that!
* TODO Handle back/forward navigation                                :NEEDED:
** TODO When user uses back button, update history if needed
   Since we can't read the tab history at startup, our state will (sometimes)
   be incomplete, when a user goes 'back' to a page we didn't know of before,
   add that correct place in the current tab history.
** TODO Keep track of position in tab history
   Keep track of 'future history', ie when the user has pressed 'back' this
   should be show in the menu.
* TODO Google sync
* TODO Highlight current tab & window in popup                          :GUI:
* TODO Show thumbnail of tabs in popup                                  :GUI:
* TODO Hovering over page in popup should overlay more information      :GUI:
* TODO Copy history when cloning/opening in background
  This goes into `background.js` -- find FIXME in code.
  When there is a 'from' field, copy the history of the from.
  (But keep reference to where it was copied from?)
